### An iOS app combining a storyboard with nibs and throwing in a custom presentation

I'm trying to find ways of bringing an existing app into the 21st Century by introducing a storyboard to launch the app and present the first screen or so, then drop back to loading nibs as is currently done. If this works as I hope, I can incrementally subsume the nibs into the storybaord rather than have the Big Bang thing going on.
